# FCN-rLSTM (Vehicle Counting)

Implementation of the model FCN-rLSTM, as described in the paper: 
Zhang et al., "FCN-rLSTM: Deep spatio-temporal neural networks for vehicle counting in city cameras", *ICCV 2017*.

This code was not written by any of the authors of the original work, so small differences may exist. Use it at your own risk.
